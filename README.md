#  Georg

Georg is a macOS/iOS program for displaying and editing "geofeatures" on an Apple native MapKit map. Features are annotations and shapes such as one might find in a GEOJSON or KML file, and in fact one may import such files into a Georg document.

This is free software, and licensed to you under the terms of the GPL, version 3. (See the file COPYING.md in this repository.)
